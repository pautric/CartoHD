This article presents some lesson learned and basic principle on LIDAR data mapping.
Not really a tutorial for the tool.

** Input Lidar data
Cloud of points. Classified.


** Extracted layers

Raster data. Resolution 20cm, finest.

DSM
DTM
contours
Vegetation
Buildings



** Styling

Shading, etc.

** Adding auxiliary data

Transport network
Building
No-vegetation land: Agricultural and cadastral parcels



** Scale
What suitable scale ?
Generalisation. Level of detail management. 20cm maximum.
Zooming out to erase noise and hide imperfections.

** Mapping from vector data
Usual approach: Data capture, in raster format. Vectorisation, digitalisation, for



** Limitations - perspectives
Classification issues. Noise. Cranes. Birds. Cliffs classified as buildings. Statues classified as trees.
Poor semantic description.
Inconsistencies with auxiliary vector data - updating diffences.
Geographical dependant stlyes... contour interval
